        <h3>ELDER</h3>
        <p>As the President of a student activity, I had the chance to lead the entire organization, manage teams, and oversee every detail of our events and activities.
From big-picture planning to small moments that bring people together ‚Äî I learned how to lead with purpose, listen, support, and turn ideas into real impact.
It wasn‚Äôt always easy, but it was always worth it. üíô</p>

        <h3>SPE - Society of Petroleum Engineers</h3>
        <p>As the Head of HR in a student activity, I got to bring a professional work ethic into the world of student events and activities. My role wasn‚Äôt just about managing tasks, but about creating a supportive environment for every member to thrive.
I was responsible for recruiting and training members, gathering content, and helping the team align their skills and passions with the mission of our activities. It was all about balancing the real-world HR practices ‚Äî like performance management, problem-solving, and communication ‚Äî with the dynamic, fast-paced student life.
I helped the team work together effectively, solving problems on the go, and keeping everyone motivated, making sure our events ran smoothly and our members were always supported.</p>

        <h3>Ministry of Youth and Sports</h3>
        <p> Event planning is one of my favorite things ‚Äî I‚Äôve organized many events like Torasna El 3raby, Capitano, and Children Around the World Festival.
I love working on everything from creative ideas and detailed plans, to team coordination and smooth execution.
I‚Äôve also delivered soft skills sessions on teamwork and how to organize events, and I enjoy turning ideas into real, meaningful experiences.
and PowerPoint? Presentations? That‚Äôs my playground!

        <h3>Minders</h3>
        <p> journey, I had the chance to teach team members practical skills that made our events and projects shine!
I introduced them to:
The types of materials we use in decorations and packages (T-shirts, IDs, medals, notebooks‚Ä¶) ‚Äî and yep, I‚Äôve already done it hands-on!
How to search for workshop and event venues like a pro.
Basics of logistics and supply chain ‚Äî getting the right things to the right place at the right time.
Project and event management ‚Äî planning, organizing, and making it happen smoothly.
The magic of color theory and decoration tips that turn any space into an experience.
And of course‚Ä¶ how to organize fun and meaningful outings ‚Äî I‚Äôve even run a whole outing series!
Because knowledge means more when it‚Äôs shared ‚ù§Ô∏è

        <p>Through my experience, I got to learn ‚Äî and teach ‚Äî some key skills that make any team stronger:
How to handle interviews and phone calls professionally
Creating member profiles and giving constructive feedback
Supporting team members and helping solve their challenges

        <h3>Minders</h3>
        <p>Diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SQL, and Problem Solving Concepts has been an exciting journey! I‚Äôve not only learned the theory behind them, but I‚Äôve also applied these concepts in Python to build real-world solutions.
From designing clean, efficient code using OOP principles to mastering SQL queries for managing databases, I‚Äôve sharpened my problem-solving skills and learned how to break down complex challenges into manageable steps. Python became my go-to tool to bring ideas to life and solve problems with precision.
It‚Äôs all about creating robust solutions that work seamlessly, while continuously learning and improving!</p>

        <h3>Resala Charity</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôve had the privilege of participating in various charity activities and community service projects that truly touched my heart. We‚Äôve traveled to poor villages to help those in need, distributing clothes and food to families who need it most.
We‚Äôve also spent time with children battling cancer, bringing joy and comfort to their lives, even if just for a moment. Another rewarding experience was working with children who lacked financial resources, teaching them skills and giving them a chance to learn and grow despite the challenges they face.
These experiences remind me every day of the power of giving and how small acts of kindness can create ripples of positive change.</p>
