        <p> Event planning is one of my favorite things — I’ve organized many events like Torasna El 3raby, Capitano, and Children Around the World Festival.
I love working on everything from creative ideas and detailed plans, to team coordination and smooth execution.
I’ve also delivered soft skills sessions on teamwork and how to organize events, and I enjoy turning ideas into real, meaningful experiences.
and PowerPoint? Presentations? That’s my playground!

        <h3>Minders</h3>
        <p> journey, I had the chance to teach team members practical skills that made our events and projects shine!
I introduced them to:
The types of materials we use in decorations and packages (T-shirts, IDs, medals, notebooks…) — and yep, I’ve already done it hands-on!
How to search for workshop and event venues like a pro.
Basics of logistics and supply chain — getting the right things to the right place at the right time.
Project and event management — planning, organizing, and making it happen smoothly.
The magic of color theory and decoration tips that turn any space into an experience.
And of course… how to organize fun and meaningful outings — I’ve even run a whole outing series!
Because knowledge means more when it’s shared ❤️

        <p> definitely one of my favorites!
I learned and practiced so many things that shaped how I work today:

Giving thoughtful feedback and managing performance
Doing research, writing professional emails, and improving my technical writing
Working on R&D, and even negotiating with partners during the selection process
Supporting members and solving problems with empathy
Managing my time while being an HR for two committees with around 30 members, and also handling HR tasks for TechSolve workshop with 50+ participants — all while being a student!

        <h3>Minders</h3>
        <p>Through this experience, I explored both the creative and practical sides of event planning:
Learned about different types of materials and how to use them in decorations and packages — like T-shirts, IDs, medals, notebooks, and bookmarks
Discovered the types of events and how to plan them from A to Z — including organizing the successful First Step 2022 event
Got to know how to plan fun and smooth outings — and we pulled off a great one!
Took on the role of Virtual Head for the First Step Event and loved leading the team behind the scenes

        <h3>career zoom</h3>
        <p>In our committee, we had two main sections: Fundraising (FR) and Public Relations (PR) — and we learned a lot by doing!
How to reach out to sponsors and partners — and we actually got many on board!
Creating a professional LinkedIn profile and building strong connections
Writing and using phone call scripts to communicate clearly
Helping organize impactful workshops that leave a mark
It was all about connecting, communicating, and creating real value.
